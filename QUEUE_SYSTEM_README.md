# Automotive Service Management System - Queue System

## Overview
The system now includes an intelligent queuing system that allows multiple users to book the same time slot when all advisors are busy. Instead of rejecting bookings, users are automatically added to a queue and assigned advisors as they become available.

## How It Works

### 1. Immediate Booking
- When a user books a time slot and an advisor is available, the booking is confirmed immediately
- The advisor is assigned based on service type specialization and availability

### 2. Queue System
- When all advisors are busy at a requested time slot, the user is automatically added to a queue
- Queue position is determined by first-come-first-served order
- Estimated service time is calculated based on queue position

### 3. Automatic Processing
- When an advisor completes a service or becomes available, the queue is automatically processed
- The next person in the queue is assigned an advisor and their status changes from "Queued" to "Confirmed"
- Queue positions are updated for remaining users

## Key Features

### Queue Management
- **Queue Position**: Each queued booking gets a position number
- **Estimated Service Time**: Calculated based on queue position and service duration
- **Automatic Processing**: Queue is processed when advisors become available
- **Real-time Updates**: Queue information is displayed in real-time

### User Experience
- **Transparent Information**: Users can see their queue position and estimated wait time
- **Flexible Cancellation**: Users can leave the queue anytime before service starts
- **Clear Status**: Queued bookings show "Queued" status with purple color coding
- **Queue Details**: Users can see detailed queue information including wait times

### Management Features
- **Queue Monitoring**: Managers can view queue information for all time slots
- **Manual Processing**: Managers can manually process queues if needed
- **Audit Logging**: All queue operations are logged for tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- Added new fields to Booking model:
  - `queuePosition`: Position in queue
  - `isQueued`: Boolean flag for queued status
  - `queueStartTime`: When booking entered queue
  - `estimatedServiceTime`: Estimated time when service will start
  - `status`: New "Queued" status option

### API Endpoints
- `POST /bookings` - Creates booking or adds to queue
- `GET /bookings/available-slots` - Shows queue information for time slots
- `GET /bookings/queue-info` - Detailed queue information for specific time slot
- `POST /bookings/process-queue` - Manual queue processing (managers only)

### Queue Logic
- Queue is processed automatically when:
  - A service is completed
  - A booking is cancelled
  - An advisor becomes available
- Queue positions are updated in real-time
- Estimated service times are recalculated

## User Interface Updates
