# Parts Seeding Summary Report

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Supplier Names Issue in Parts Form
- **Problem**: Parts form was not showing supplier names in the "Preferred Suppliers" dropdown
- **Root Cause**: Backend API returned suppliers with `companyName` field, but frontend expected `name` field
